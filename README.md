Machine /Deep Learning based atatck is widely utilized nowadays on logic locing.In this regard,GNN and other cutting edge role plays a vital role to work  more efficently.
However,these traing requires to preprocess netlist in order to adopt in a DL models.This repository shows how we can transform a netlist to a grpah with adjacent metrics
containg all related info of each node and edges.Here,as C432 netlist is leverged,but ca be utilized any other netlist as well.
